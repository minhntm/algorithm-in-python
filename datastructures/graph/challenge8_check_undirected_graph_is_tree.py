Problem Statement:
- The next section will tackle the tree data structure.
    For now, hereâ€™s the basic difference between a graph and a tree.
    A graph can only be a tree under two conditions:
        There are no cycles.
        The graph is connected.
    A graph is connected when there is a path between every pair of vertices.
    In a connected graph, there are no unreachable vertices. Each vertex must
    be connected to every other vertex through either a direct edge
    or a graph traversal.

    You have to implement is_tree() function which will take a graph as
    an input and find out if it is a tree.

Input:
- An undirected graph.
Output:
- Returns True if the given graph is a tree. Otherwise, it returns False.

Sample Input:
    graph = {
        0 - 1
        0 - 2
        0 - 3
        3 - 4  
    }
Sample Output:
- True
