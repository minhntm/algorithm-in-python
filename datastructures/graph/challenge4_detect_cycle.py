"""
Problem Statement:
- The concept of loops or cycles is very common in graph theory.
    A cycle exists when you traverse the directed graph and come upon a vertex
    that has already been visited.
    You have to implement the detect_cycle function which tells you
    whether or not a graph contains a cycle.

Input:
- A directed graph.
Output:
- True if a cycle exists. False if it doesnâ€™t.

Sample Input:
    graph = {
        0 -> 1 
        1 -> 2
        2 -> 0
    }
Sample Output:
- True
